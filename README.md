# Morat agent swarm

## Getting Started

This is a basic agent swarm, where they will transfer a random amount to a friend every time they act. The plan is to see how points spread through the network and if there are any skews or degenerate cases that emerge after things have been running for a long time.

## Development

To start the development server run:
```bash
bun run dev --watch
```

It expects the morat reference API to be running locally on port 3000.
